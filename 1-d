# Step 1: Upload the image
uploaded = files.upload()

# Step 2: Get the filename
filename = next(iter(uploaded))

# Step 3: Read the image and convert to grayscale
image = cv2.imread(filename)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Step 4: Create a kernel
kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8)

# Step 5: Apply dilation
dilated = cv2.dilate(gray, kernel, iterations=1)

# Step 6: Show the dilated image
cv2_imshow(dilated)

# Step 7: Save the result
cv2.imwrite('dilated_output.jpg', dilated)
