# Step 1: Upload the image
uploaded = files.upload()

# Step 2: Get the uploaded filename
filename = next(iter(uploaded))

# Step 3: Read and convert image to grayscale
image = cv2.imread(filename)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Step 4: Create a kernel
kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8)

# Step 5: Apply erosion
eroded = cv2.erode(gray, kernel, iterations=1)

# Step 6: Show the eroded image
cv2_imshow(eroded)

# Step 7: Save the result
cv2.imwrite('eroded_output.jpg', eroded)
